# Crypto Market

![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/github/license/LautaroJBeck/cryptoapi) ![Last Commit](https://img.shields.io/github/last-commit/LautaroJBeck/cryptoapi)

Crypto Market is a React/Next.js web application that provides real-time information on the top cryptocurrencies by market capitalization. It displays key data for the top 100 coins (price, market cap, 24h volume, 24h change, and supply) and also shows global market statistics (total crypto market cap, 24h changes, BTC/ETH dominance). The app fetches live data from a cryptocurrency API (such as CoinGecko) to ensure up-to-date information. This is similar to other crypto dashboard apps that list cryptocurrencies with their current prices and market data.

## Features

* **Top 100 Cryptocurrencies**: View a sortable list of the top 100 coins by market capitalization.
* **Coin Details**: For each cryptocurrency, see detailed information including current price, 24h trading volume, market cap, and circulating supply.
* **Global Stats**: Displays the overall market capitalization of all cryptocurrencies and its 24h change, as well as the dominance of BTC and ETH.
* **Real-Time Data**: Data is fetched in real-time from a crypto market API (e.g., CoinGecko) to keep prices and stats current.
* **Responsive UI**: Fully responsive design that works on desktop and mobile devices.
* **Search (Optional)**: *(If implemented)* Quickly search for specific cryptocurrencies in the list.

## Technologies Used

* **React.js**: JavaScript library for building the user interface.
* **CSS (Modules or Global)**: Styling, using either CSS Modules or global CSS files under the `styles/` directory.
* **Cryptocurrency API**: Integration with a public crypto data API such as CoinGecko or CoinPaprika for market data.
* **Axios or Fetch**: HTTP client for making API requests to retrieve crypto data.
* **Node.js**: Runtime environment (used by Next.js for building/running the app).
* **Vercel**: Deployment platform (Next.js is designed to be easily deployed on Vercel).

## Folder Structure

├── helpers/         # Utility functions (API calls, data formatting, etc.)
├── pages/           # Next.js pages (e.g., index.js for home page)

```

* **components/**: Contains reusable React components for the UI.
* **helpers/**: Contains helper functions for fetching and formatting data.
* **pages/**: Next.js pages that define routes (e.g., the home page).
* **public/**: Static assets like images or the site favicon.
* **styles/**: CSS files (either global or module-scoped for components).

## Installation & Setup

To get started with the project, follow these steps:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/LautaroJBeck/cryptoapi.git
cd cryptoapi
npm install
```

This will clone the repository and install all dependencies. (If the project requires any API keys or environment variables, make sure to set those up as needed.)

## Running and Building the App

* **Run in development mode:**

  ```bash
  npm run dev
  ```

  This starts the development server. Open your browser to `http://localhost:3000` to view the app.

* **Build for production:**

  ```bash
  npm run build
  ```

  This creates an optimized production build of the app.

* **Start production server locally:**

  ```bash
  npm start
  ```

  Serves the production build.

*(These commands follow the standard Next.js scripts; for example, `npm run dev` is also shown in a similar crypto app.)*

## Deployment

This project can be easily deployed on Vercel. Next.js applications are designed for seamless deployment on the Vercel platform (created by the Next.js team). To deploy:

1. Create a Vercel account and link it to your GitHub repository.
2. Vercel will automatically detect the Next.js project and suggest the correct build settings (no changes usually needed).
3. Click **Deploy**, and Vercel will build and host the app.

Alternatively, you can use the Vercel CLI:

```bash
npm install -g vercel
vercel login
vercel
```

Then follow the prompts to deploy. The app will be accessible via a Vercel-provided URL. (The Next.js docs note that Vercel is the “easiest way to deploy Next.js to production”.)
